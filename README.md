# airspace
Github client. Test task for Airspace


## Run the application `php artisan serve`

There is *.env.example* file which has to rename with *.env* and database credentials should be changed too.

I used php laravel for back-end and Reactjs for front-end

For the server-side controller is located under  app/Http/Controllers/CommitController.php. Model is located under app/Commit.php

Reactjs files are in the resources/js/components/* 
Loader file is in views/welcome.blade.php

I have included vendor folder as well just in case but if for some reason there will be missing packages it might need to run `composer install`

and then it will work on 8000 port. 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000
