# airspace
Github client. Test task for Airspace


## Run the application `php artisan serve`

I used php laravel for back-end and Reactjs for front-end


For the server side controller is located under  app/Http/Controllers/CommitController.php. Model is located under app/Commit.php

Reactjs files are in the resources/js/components/* 
Loader file is in views/welcome.blade.php

I have included vendor folder as well just in case but for some reason there will be missing packages it might need to run `composer install`
